About me (updated 2021):
Myself Hari Shankar Govindasamy joined Chritian Doppler Laboratory on Model-Integrated Smart Production (CDL-MINT) in 2021. His current working is to create Machine Learning models on practical applications with combination of Digital Twins and Microsoft Azure platform.

He is currently persuing his master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence at JKU. He previous work as research technician was to integrate new sensors and Develop state of art 3d printers in Department of Additive Manufacturing at Montanuniversität Leoben. He did Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering with specialization of Production and Manufacturing and his Bachelor’s Thesis was ‘Design and Development of Metal 3d-printer in SLS – Selective Lasar Melting.

### Project & Thesis Description: 

In this final Bachelor's thesis, "Design of 3D-Printer" provides advanced design model of SLS 3D-Printer after reviewing several
existing printers. Some of them were compared with overall designs. New technology of twin laser system is introduced. 

Advanced analysis and calculation for Sintering process and necessary calculations for drive components has derived. CAD model of the entire
printer is designed with some unique features. Strength calculation has been made and electrical control scheme has been designed.

Physical properties of the material that are to be sintered is analyzed (Nylon PA-12). Requirements of the laser system have been
shown.

In the technological part, the work and machining details are shown for the chosen part. The machining environment and work
safety requirements have been detailed for the machine and operator. 

The economic calculations have been made for the making of
this printer such as fixed costs, variable costs versus sales cost for mass production is derived.

This work contains 50 pages of text without appendixes, 20 figures, 29 references, Graphical part consist of 4 pieces A1 sheets.
